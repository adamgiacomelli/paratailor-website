## Paratailor

ParaTailor is a reincarnation of ancient Delphi project, used around 20 years ago by Air Systems,Sky Paragliders and others around year 2000. Fever, Flirt, NjamNjam, Tanov were designed by it.

ParaTailor is new, fully revised project with new features written in C++. It fully exports everything what is created in it to DXF format.

Aerodynamic analysis is incorporated also in the program, with a response time almost in real time, a questions of minutes, not hours !!! Just try it !
